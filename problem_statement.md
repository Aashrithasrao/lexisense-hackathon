## Title  
**Sentiment analysis of comments received through E-consultation module**

---

## Background  
The eConsultation module is an online platform where proposed amendments and draft legislations are posted on the MCA's website. External users can submit comments and suggestions through the MCA21 portal. These comments are captured in a structured format for due consideration when amending draft legislations.

---

## Problem Statement  
During the consultation period, stakeholders may provide observations either on the overall amendment or on specific provisions of the draft legislation.  
When a large volume of comments is received, there is a risk that certain observations may be overlooked or insufficiently analyzed.  

AI-assisted tools can help ensure that all remarks are systematically analyzed and given due consideration.  

The requirement is to develop an **AI model** that:  
- Predicts the **sentiments** of stakeholder suggestions.  
- Generates a **summary** of comments.  
- Creates a **word cloud** highlighting key terms used in the suggestions.  

---

## Expected Outcome  
The solution should:  
- Clearly identify the **sentiment of each comment** as well as the **overall sentiment**.  
- Provide **accurate summaries** that preserve the meaning of the comments in a concise form.  
- Generate a **word cloud** showing the density of words frequently used by stakeholders.  

This will reduce the effort required to analyze high volumes of comments and improve the effectiveness of the consultation process.
