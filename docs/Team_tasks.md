📝 Team To-Do List — LexiSense Hackathon
========================================

This document breaks down tasks for each team member.

Goal: build a Streamlit app using Hugging Face pipelines for sentiment analysis, summarization, and word cloud generation.

Everyone should commit code frequently and test often.

👤 Person 1: Team Lead / Integrator
-----------------------------------

*   \[ \] Create GitHub repo and push initial folder structure.
    
*   \[ \] Guide team on workflow: comments → analysis → visualization.
    
*   \[ \] Integrate all functions into one Streamlit app.
    
*   \[ \] Write short demo script for presentation.
    
*   \[ \] Ensure final app runs smoothly end-to-end.
    

👤 Person 2: Streamlit UI
-------------------------

*   \[ \] Learn Streamlit basics from [Streamlit Docs](https://docs.streamlit.io/).
    
*   \[ \] Create input box for single comment analysis.
    
*   \[ \] Add CSV upload for multiple comments.
    
*   \[ \] Display sentiment and summary results in a clean table.
    
*   \[ \] Add tabs or sections (Sentiment / Summaries / Word Cloud).
    

👤 Person 3: Sentiment Analysis
-------------------------------

*   \[ \] Learn Hugging Face pipeline for sentiment analysis.
    
*   Pythondef analyze\_sentiment(text: str) -> dict: return {"label": "POSITIVE", "score": 0.98}
    
*   \[ \] Test on 5–10 sample comments.
    
*   \[ \] Share function with UI teammate.
    

👤 Person 4: Summarization
--------------------------

*   \[ \] Learn Hugging Face pipeline for summarization.
    
*   Pythondef summarize\_text(text: str) -> str: return "Short summary here."
    
*   \[ \] Test with longer comments (3–4 sentences).
    
*   \[ \] Share function with UI teammate.
    

👤 Person 5: Word Cloud & Visualization
---------------------------------------

*   \[ \] Learn basics of wordcloud and matplotlib.
    
*   \[ \] Write function to generate PNG word cloud from all comments.
    
*   \[ \] Add pie/bar chart for sentiment counts with st.bar\_chart.
    
*   \[ \] Share visualization functions with UI teammate.
    

👤 Person 6: Backend & Testing
------------------------------

*   \[ \] Pre-download Hugging Face models so they work offline.
    
*   \[ \] Test all modules separately (sentiment, summary, word cloud).
    
*   \[ \] Handle errors (empty input, very long comments).
    
*   \[ \] Confirm Streamlit app runs with streamlit run app.py.
    
*   \[ \] Help polish UI and debug before final demo.
    

✅ Final Integration Steps
-------------------------

*   \[ \] Combine all functions in app/app.py.
    
*   \[ \] Test workflow: Upload CSV → Analyze → Show Word Cloud.
    
*   \[ \] Fix bugs as a team.
    
*   \[ \] Add color-coded results (green = positive, red = negative, yellow = neutral).
    
*   \[ \] Run a dry demo before presenting.
    

⚡ Tips
------

*   Keep code simple (10–20 lines per function is fine).
    
*   Commit daily to GitHub.
    
*   Don’t wait if stuck — ask the lead.
    
*   Always test with sample comments before integration.
